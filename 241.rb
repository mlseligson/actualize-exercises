# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# 3) Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
#    For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].

    i += 1

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? No.
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. Writing out arrays and loops
