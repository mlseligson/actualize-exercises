# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# 3) Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of string values from each hash's :name key.
#    For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes ["Alice", "Blane"].

names = []
[{name: "Criss Angel", age: 27}, {name: "Garrison Harrison", age: 16}].each do |person| 
    names.push(person[:name])
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? 

# I had difficulty at first, then decided to spend denote time mindfulness in nature and come back to it.

# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. 
# I will continue on classes and enumerate my skills.
