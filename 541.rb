# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.



# Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
# For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].

words = ["wing", "the", "ham", "bone", "wichita", "doberman", "loosening", "ghosts", "whirlybirds", "what", "yes", "egg", "cow", "wow", "mmmmm", "quail", "algeria", "mennonite", "woah"]

w_words = words.select { |word| word[0] == "w" }

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? Yes.
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. Discovery and decompisition. 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
