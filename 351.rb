# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# 10) Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number converted into a string.  For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes ["1", "2", "3"].

numbers = [5, 3, 3, 8, 42]
strings = numbers.map { |n| n.to_s }

pp strings


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? Yes
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. Deliberate practe of decomposition.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
