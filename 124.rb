# QUESTION 1
# Write code to store a number in a variable.
# Then write a condition that 
# prints -1 if the number is less than 10, 
# prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, 
# and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

number = 85
if (number < 10)
  puts -1
elsif (number > 10)
  puts 1
else
  puts 0
end


# QUESTION 2
# There are two mistakes with the code below. 
# One mistake will cause the code to crash. 
# The other mistake doesn't cause the code to crash, but it is unnecessary code. 
# Fix both mistakes.

x = 100

# All of this is unneccesary... x >= 100
if x < 5
  puts 0
elsif x < 50
  puts 1
elsif x < 100
  puts 2
end
