# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# 2) Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.  For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].

strings = ["SARAH", "CONNOR", "LARA", "CROFT"]

STRINGS = strings.map { |word| word.upcase }

pp STRINGS


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? Yes
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. Deliberate practice
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
